Hi every one. Let me give a brief description what to expected from this blog.
This blog is dedicated to having ideas, and somtime realizing them. But mainly
for wirting down

* funny
* stupid
* bizaar
* senseless
* unreflected

ideas. This blog is a way of saying: "Haha, I already said this years ago". Or at
least it could be become such an document.

In some sense also starting this blog is an idea, my dear friend Philipp and I
had a few weeks ago. To Philipp and his hundreds of thousands ideas I'd like to
dedicate this blog.

So hopefully, there will be more than this one entry. If not this blog becomes
an other unrelized idea in our large pool.

To the future and all great thoughts in this world

Yves
